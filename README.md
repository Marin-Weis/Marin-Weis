## 📂 Projects  

### 🔹 First Aid Application
- **Description:** Major end-of-first-year project developed as part of a team of four (Arthur Jan, Mathieu Gouelo, Nolann Lescop, and myself). The application allows rescuers to register, declare their skills (PSE1, PSE2, SSA, etc.), and view assigned deployments (DPS). Administrators manage rescuers' competencies and automatically assign deployments using an algorithm based on skills and availability. All operations are connected to a secure database.  
- **Technologies used:** Java / MySQL / JavaFX / XML  
- **What I learned:** Team collaboration, CRUD operations, database management, implementing an assignment algorithm, and full-stack development.  
- **Demo / Repo:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Marin-Weis/PROJECT-First-aid-application)


### 🟦 Dual – Biathlon Cycle Evaluation App (Android / Kotlin)

- **Dual (Cycle de Biathlon en Éducation Physique)** is a mobile application designed to support Physical Education (PE) teachers during **biathlon evaluation sessions** in 4th grade.  
The project is developed in collaboration between the **IUT de Vannes** and the **Collège Notre-Dame-La-Blanche (Theix-Noyalo)**.

- The goal is to provide a **fully offline, real-time, local, and autonomous Android application** capable of managing student performance during biathlon sessions combining:
  - Running  
  - Laser shooting  
  - VMA calculations  
  - Penalty laps  

- A first functional prototype is expected for **January 2026**.
